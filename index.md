# Who am I?

I'm a Software Engineer and Software Security Researcher with a bachelors degree in Robotics and Computer Science from
Worcester Polytechnic Institute [(WPI)](https://www.wpi.edu/).

I was honnored to be the first ever [Dan Kaminsky Fellow](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/spotlight-on-first-dan-kaminsky-fellow-jonathan-leitschuh).

I love Robots, well designed and tested code, surfing, & video gaming.

One of my overarching goals in life is to help make the world a better place.
I get satisfaction from contributing to open source projects.
