# Who am I?

My name is Jonathan Leitschuh and I'm a Senior Software Security Researcher. I'm a [GitHub Star](https://stars.github.com/profiles/jlleitschuh/), former GitHub Security Ambassador, & was the inagural [Dan Kaminsky Fellow](https://www.darkreading.com/edge-articles/spotlight-on-first-dan-kaminsky-fellow-jonathan-leitschuh) @ [HUMAN Security](https://www.humansecurity.com/learn/blog/our-first-dan-kaminsky-fellow). I previously worked for the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) [Project Alpha Omega](https://openssf.org/community/alpha-omega/) focused on finding and reporting OSS vulnerabilities. As a public speaker, I've spoken at conferences like ShmooCon, BSidses CT, BSides LV, Black Hat, & DEFCON. I'm fortunate to have been featured by [GitHub's README project](https://github.com/readme/stories/jonathan-leitschuh)!

I have an undergraduate degree in Robotics and Computer Science from Worcester Polytechnic Institute [(WPI)](https://www.wpi.edu/).

I believe in the power of community and collaboration. I'm passionate about open source software and its potential to drive innovation and improve security across the industry.

If you'd like to get in touch, the best way is to DM me on X [@JLLeitschuh](https://twitter.com/jlleitschuh) or direct message me in the [Open Source Security Foundation](https://openssf.org/getinvolved/) Slack Channel.
