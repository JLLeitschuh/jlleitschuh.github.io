# Who am I?

I'm a Software Engineer with a bachelors degree in Robotics and Computer Science from
Worcester Polytechnic Institute [(WPI)](https://www.wpi.edu/).

I'm currently working for Plexxi Inc. which has just been acquired by
Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE).

I love Robots, well designed and tested code, surfing, & video gaming.

One of my overarching goals in life is to help make the world a better place.
I get satisfaction from contributing to open source projects.
