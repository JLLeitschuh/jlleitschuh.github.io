# Sailing

Sailing is a passion of mine. I love the freedom it provides and the connection to nature. I personally own a Hobie Gettaway Catamaran. You can also frequently find me out sailing at Boston's [Community Boating Incorporated (CBI)](https://www.community-boating.org/). Below are some resources I've compiled that might be helpful for fellow sailing enthusiasts:

## Sailing Resources

Since I own a Hobie Getaway Catamaran, the boat doesn't have a motor, so I can't launch the boat anywhere where there are strong currents, or a low bridge blocking access to the ocean.

This is a map of all the places I can launch my boat in the MA area. If you have any suggestions for other places I should add, please [open an issue](https://github.com/jlleitschuh/jlleitschuh.github.io/issues/new).
